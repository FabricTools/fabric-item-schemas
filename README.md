# fabric-item-schemas

Provides git diff/history views of all Fabric item definition schemas at <https://github.com/microsoft/json-schemas/tree/main/fabric/item>.

Unlike the original schemas, which are versioned side-by-side, this repository maintains the version history of the schemas in a single file. This allows for easier comparison of changes over time.

Each schema update is annotated with a corresponding tag, for instance `report-page-1.1.0`.
